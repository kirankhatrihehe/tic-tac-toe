1. What does getCell(int row, int col) return if the coordinates are invalid (like -1, 5)?
If the coordinates are outside the valid range (0–2), getCell() returns a space character ' '. This is how the function signals that the position doesn’t exist on the board.

2. What does getWinner() return when there is no winner yet?
If nobody has won yet, getWinner() also returns a space character ' '. It basically means there is no current winner.

3. Why is getWinner() marked const, but makeMove() is not?
getWinner() is marked const because it only checks the board and doesn’t change anything.
makeMove() isn’t const because it actually updates the board, changes the current player, and increases the move count.

4. If the board is full but nobody has won, what should isGameOver() return?
It should return true. Even if there’s no winner, a full board means the game is over and ends in a tie.

5. What does getCurrentPlayer() return at the start of a new game?
At the start, getCurrentPlayer() returns 'X', since X always plays first in this version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
